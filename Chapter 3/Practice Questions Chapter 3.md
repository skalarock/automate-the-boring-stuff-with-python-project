8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?

- None if there is return value

9. How can you force a variable in a function to refer to the global variable?

- Use global statement

10. What is the data type of None?

- NoneType

11. What does the import areallyourpetsnamederic statement do?

12. If you had a function named bacon() in a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?

- You call it as spam.bacon()

13. How can you prevent a program from crashing when it gets an error?
